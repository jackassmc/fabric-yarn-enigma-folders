	CLASS class_4762 MixedNoisePoint
		COMMENT Represents a point in a multi-dimensional cartesian plane. Mixed-noise
		COMMENT biome generator picks the closest noise point from its selected point
		COMMENT and choose the biome associated to that closest point. Another factor,
		COMMENT rarity potential, favors larger differences in values instead, contrary
		COMMENT to other point values.

			COMMENT This value awards another point with value farthest from this one; i.e.
			COMMENT unlike other points where closer distance is better, for this value the

			COMMENT approximately modeled by a hyperbola weight=cosh(peak-1) as used by the
			COMMENT mixed-noise generator.
