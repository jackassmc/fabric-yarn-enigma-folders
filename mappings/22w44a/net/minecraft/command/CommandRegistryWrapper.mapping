CLASS net/minecraft/class_7225 net/minecraft/command/CommandRegistryWrapper
	COMMENT A wrapper of a registry, used in command arguments.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The methods in this class in most cases perform the same as ones defined
	COMMENT in {@link Registry}. However, subclasses may have slightly different behaviors
	COMMENT to make it easier to handle user-passed arguments. For example, {@link #getEntryList(TagKey)}
	COMMENT may return an empty {@link RegistryEntryList} instead of {@link Optional#empty()}.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A wrapper without any special behaviors can be created by calling {@link of(Registry)}.
