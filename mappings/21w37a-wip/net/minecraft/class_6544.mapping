	CLASS class_4762 MixedNoisePoint
		COMMENT Represents a point in a multi-dimensional cartesian plane. Mixed-noise
		COMMENT biome generator picks the closest noise point from its selected point
		COMMENT and choose the biome associated to that closest point. Another factor,
		COMMENT rarity potential, favors larger differences in values instead, contrary
		COMMENT to other point values.

		FIELD field_22047 weight F
			COMMENT This value awards another point with value farthest from this one; i.e.
			COMMENT unlike other points where closer distance is better, for this value the
			COMMENT farther the better. The result of the different values can be
			COMMENT approximately modeled by a hyperbola weight=cosh(peak-1) as used by the
			COMMENT mixed-noise generator.

		METHOD method_24381 calculateDistanceTo (Lnet/minecraft/class_6544$class_6553;)F
			COMMENT Calculates the distance from this noise point to another one. The
			COMMENT distance is a squared distance in a multi-dimensional cartesian plane
			COMMENT from a mathematical point of view, with a special parameter that
			COMMENT reduces the calculated distance.
			COMMENT
			COMMENT <p>For most fields except weight, smaller difference between
			COMMENT two points' fields will lead to smaller distance. For weight,
			COMMENT larger differences lead to smaller distance.
			COMMENT
			COMMENT <p>This distance is used by the mixed-noise biome layer source. The
			COMMENT layer source calculates an arbitrary noise point, and selects the
			COMMENT biome that offers a closest point to its arbitrary point.
